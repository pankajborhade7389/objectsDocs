Topic: Kubernetes Object Model

The Kubernetes Platform contains control over the resources related to Storage and Compute

List of five types of Object model:
i] Namespace
ii] POD
iii] Replicaset
iv] Deployment
v] Service

Following are the key objects which exist in the Kubernetes:

**Pod

It is the smallest and simplest basic unit of the Kubernetes application. This object indicates the processes which are running in the cluster.

**Node

A node is nothing but a single host, which is used to run the virtual or physical machines. A node in the Kubernetes cluster is also known as a minion.

**Service

A service in a Kubernetes is a logical set of pods, which works together. With the help of services, users can easily manage load balancing configurations.

**ReplicaSet

A ReplicaSet in the Kubernetes is used to identify the particular number of pod replicas are running at a given time. It replaces the replication controller because it is more powerful and allows a user to use the "set-based" label selector.

**Namespace

Kubernetes supports various virtual clusters, which are known as namespaces. It is a way of dividing the cluster resources between two or more users.


**NameSpace:
   -  Namespace is like a package name, Logical partionaning of the kubernities cluster is said to be Namespace.
   -  Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters
   -  Any resource that exists within Kubernetes exists either in the default namespace or a namespace that is created by the cluster operator
   -  Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.
   -  Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.
   -  To create namespace ,  my-namespace.yaml
   -  To Run namespace - kubectl create -f ./my-namespace.yaml
   -  To list the namespace in Cluster we should use below command 
         kubectl get namespaces
   -  To delete Namespace - kubectl delete namespaces <insert-some-namespace-name>

**PODS
   -  Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
   -  A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.
   -  A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes
   -  To Create a POD , kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/simple-pod.yaml

**Replica Set
   -  A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.
   -  Commands which are listed to operate on Replica set

Deployment
   -  A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
   -  We can create a deployment by using following command , kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
   -  To check if the deployed or not , use the below command kubectl get deployments
   -  To get deployment roll out status- kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
   -  Attaching the link which includes all the command and also the commands if we get any error,
